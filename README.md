# Matcher2.0

This repository contains all the codes used to find the closest match for each school name in the Saber11 Database using the Saber359 Databases. 

## Scripts
**matcher_saber.py:** This script contains all the functions needed. From the class school (which contains the matcher algorithm), to the function that performs the loop over each school, and an additional function that creates a Do-File to be used in Stata for pairing the schools. 

**implementation.py:** It imports the data and runs the functions written in the previous script.
