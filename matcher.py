# Matcher 2.0

# In order for the matcher to work, you need to have installed the following libraries:
# Numpy, Pandas, FuzzyWuzzy, python-Levenshtein and xlsxwriter.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
from fuzzywuzzy import process

# The Following lines import the databases that contains the schools names. We use pandas for convenience.

dir = r"C:\Users\JuanEduardo\PycharmProjects\CodingThings" # The directory where they are located
saber11 = pd.read_csv(dir+"\Matcher11.csv")                # The Saber 11째 Database
saber11 = saber11.values

saber3 = pd.read_csv(dir+"\Matcher359.csv")                # Saber 3째, 5째, 9째 Database
saber3 = saber3.values

# We defined an object called School as follows:
class school:
    """ The school class is created for each school. Using the information contained in this class,
        and provided a set for comparisons, the user is able to find the closest match (if it's reasonable)
        by using the available geographical and institutional information combined with one string distance measure:
        the Levenshtein distance of transformations, as provided fue the FuzzyWuzzy Library.

        Attributes:
        ---------------------
            information: A NumPy array that contains all the school's information in the following order:

                         Each row of the array is thought as a school. And has the same column-order as the original:

            The extractOne function of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Library extracts the most similar school name to the original.
            In the method matcher, the algorithm searches for all the comparisons that have the same name as the closest match.
            There might be some solutions that are not ideal provided the information available, and it discards them.


            Parameters
            --------------
            solution: It's the vector of posible solutions based on the closest match. All of them have the same name,

            Returns
            --------------

                the solutions that either the same DANE and municipality, or all the solutions that have either the DANE
                code or the municipality code.

                Cases:
                    1) There's exactly one solution. As there are no more options, it returns it.
                    2) There are more than one solutions:
                        a. If the school has all its information available, then searches for all the solutions
                           that have the SAME municipality AND DANE code. If there are none, it looks for all
                           the solutions that have the same municipality. If there are none, then it looks
                           to all the solutions that have the same DANE code, and if there are none, it returns
                           zeroes.

                        b. If the school only has its municipality available, it only returns the ones
                           with the same municipality. (This discards the solutions given by the na_choice)

                        c. If the school only has its DANE code, it only returns the soltuions with the
                           same code. (This also discards the na_choice solutions)

                        d. If the school doesn't have any information available, it discards ALL the solutions.

                        Therefore, one only trust in the na_choice when there's an exact match with another school.
