# In order for the matcher to work, you need to have installed the following libraries:
# Numpy, Pandas, FuzzyWuzzy, python-Levenshtein and xlsxwriter.


import numpy as np

from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
from fuzzywuzzy import process

# The Following lines import the databases that contains the schools names. We use pandas for convenience.

# We defined an object called School as follows:
class school:
    """ The school class is created for each school. Using the information contained in this class,
        and provided a set for comparisons, the user is able to find the closest match (if it's reasonable)
        by using the available geographical and institutional information combined with one string distance measure:
        the Levenshtein distance of transformations, as provided fue the FuzzyWuzzy Library.

        Attributes:

            There might be some solutions that are not ideal provided the information available, and it discards them.

                the solutions that either the same DANE and municipality, or all the solutions that have either the DANE
                code or the municipality code.

                Cases:
                    1) There's exactly one solution. As there are no more options, it returns it.
                    2) There are more than one solutions:
                        a. If the school has all its information available, then searches for all the solutions
                           that have the SAME municipality AND DANE code. If there are none, it looks for all
                           the solutions that have the same municipality. If there are none, then it looks
                           to all the solutions that have the same DANE code, and if there are none, it returns
                           zeroes.

                        b. If the school only has its municipality available, it only returns the ones
                           with the same municipality. (This discards the solutions given by the na_choice)

                        c. If the school only has its DANE code, it only returns the soltuions with the
                           same code. (This also discards the na_choice solutions)

                        d. If the school doesn't have any information available, it discards ALL the solutions.

                        Therefore, one only trust in the na_choice when there's an exact match with another school.
